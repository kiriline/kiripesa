Matagor sketchbook invites you to discover forgotten dreams, the magic worlds of childhood fairy tales, colourful memories of journeys yet to be taken, existant and imagined plants, birds and animals.

You can use it for notes or drawings, fill and design it in any way you want - draw over and colour the existing images or create your own, add elements of collage. Let your inner self flow freely on these pages - this is also how Matagorâ€™s illustrations are born!

We would love to see what kind of things Matagor inspires you to create, so snap some photos and send by e-mail to hello@matagor.com. We are very much looking forward to your creations!

Happy sketching and let your creativity shine!
